Based on the code changes and commit messages from the GitHub pull request, it appears that the following updates have been made:

1. Added a step in the workflow to extract PR Number and Commit SHA from the GitHub event context and then run a Python script to generate an updated README.
2. Updated the `.gitignore` file to ignore the `venv` directory.
3. Added new dependencies to the `requirements.txt` file.
4. Modified the `utility.py` file to utilize new modules for OpenAI interaction and to update the README based on recent code changes.
5. Updated the README content with instructions for the AI to review code changes and commit messages and propose README updates.

It seems that the changes aim to automate the process of updating the README based on code changes and commit messages using an AI algorithm powered by OpenAI. The workflow extracts necessary information, runs a Python script to generate the updated README, and then creates a pull request with the proposed changes.

The README file content has been updated to include instructions for the AI to review the code changes and commit messages and propose updates to the README.
